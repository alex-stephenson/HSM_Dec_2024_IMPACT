rules for combining parent columns

    child columns will always be correctly updated with 0s and 1s (and can look up others that don't show up in the clogs as needed)

identify duplicates by making a "unique" ID of UUID & question

tokenize and identify the items that don't appear in the other

go through the child columns to identify the correct 0 or 1 for the choices

    could also just go through all of the child columns and populate a new parent column from those?

create the "correct" parent column remove the duplicate









If there is a conflict between an "only selectable by itself" and another choice, always remove the "OSBI", turn the binary to zero, and keep the other choice
